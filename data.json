The constructor specifies the context size. To use this class, after creating the object, add other feature extractors using the FeatureCollection.addFeatureExtractor(FeatureExtractor) method. Then, for each neighboring word, the feature extractor will generate features using all the extractors that have been added. Note: This class only generates features from neighboring words. To go beyond words, new code needs to be written as required.","testcode":"Copyright 1996-2003 by Elliot Joel Berk and C.
